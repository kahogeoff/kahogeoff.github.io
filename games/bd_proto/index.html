<h2>The development of this game was shelved.</h2>
<p>Here the reason:</p>
 <ol type="1">
  <li>I want to make this game in 3D.</li>
  <li>The game engine that I have used is don't meet my needs.</li>
</ol> 
<p>But you can still try this prototype at <a href="http://kahogeoff.github.io/games/bd_proto/index_game.html">here</a></p>
